# Medical Physics - Course Slides Repository

Welcome to the **Medical Physics** course slides repository! This collection comprises all the slides I meticulously prepared during my time as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Medical Physics course at [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir) under the supervision of [Dr. Malikeh Nabaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=djH2nnkAAAAJ&hl=en). These slides cover a wide range of topics, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of the physical principles underlying biological and medical phenomena.

## Repository Contents

Each PDF in this repository corresponds to a specific topic within the Medical Physics curriculum. Below is an overview of the available files:

1. **Introduction.pdf**
   - An overview of the Medical Physics course, covering fundamental concepts and the scope of the subject.

2. **Statics of Body Lesson One.pdf**
   - A more detailed look at the statics principles applied specifically to the human body, possibly part of a multi-lesson series.
        
3. **Statics and Dynamics of Human Body.pdf**
   - Examines the principles of biomechanics, including the forces and movements in the human body, and how they relate to medical conditions and treatment.

4. **Cardiovascular System.pdf**
   - Detailed insights into the physics of the cardiovascular system, including blood flow dynamics, pressure, and the mechanical properties of the heart and blood vessels.

5. **Heat and Energy.pdf**
   - Discusses the principles of thermodynamics and energy transfer in biological systems, including body temperature regulation and metabolic energy.
     
6. **Lungs and Breathing.pdf**
   - An analysis of the mechanics of respiration, gas exchange, and the physical principles behind respiratory support technologies.
     
7. **Electrical Properties of Body.pdf**
   - Explores the electrical behavior of the human body, such as bioelectric potentials, nerve conduction, and the basics of medical devices like ECG.
     
8. **Sound and Speech.pdf**
   - Covers the physics of sound, the mechanics of hearing, and the production of speech, including the technology behind hearing aids and cochlear implants.
  
9. **Light and Vision.pdf**
   - Focuses on the interaction of light with biological tissues, the physics of vision, and medical imaging techniques that use light.
